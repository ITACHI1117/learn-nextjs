Learning Next Js
What I learned
(1) page routing
(2) data fetching
3 methods of data fetching
--getStaticProps (gets data at build time)
--getServerSideProps (Fetch data on every Request (this is slower))
--getStaticPaths (To dynamically generate paths based on the data being fetched)

(3) Custom dynamic Meta Components

<!-- get Static Props -->

I was unable to use getStaticProps due to an error
